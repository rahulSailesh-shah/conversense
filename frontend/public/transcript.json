Imagine  you  are observing  someone,  let's  call  her  Alice,  who  is  orbiting  really  close  to a  black  hole,  and  you  are  further  away  in  weaker  gravity.  From  your  perspective,  you  would see  Alice's  clock  ticking  slower  than  your  clock.  If  Alice  were  sending  you  light  signals,  you  would  see  those  signals  arriving  less  frequently  than  they were  being  sent,  making  her  appear  to be  moving  slower  in  time.  However,  for  Alice,  time  seems  to be  passing  normally  for her.  She  would  see  your  clock,  which  is  further  away,  ticking  faster  than  her  clock.  It's  all  about  the relative  difference  in gravity  between  you  and  Alice.  Does  this  example  help  clarify  things  a bit  more?",
